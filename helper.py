descriptions = {"eisenhowersquadrant": "Using the Eisenhower's Quadrant concept, this project allows you to organise different tasks. You are able to add, delete, and complete tasks. You are also able to see information about different tasks, for instance when they were created and when they must be finished by. This project showcases my Python coding skills in back-end web development.", "depechehouse": "A social app which allows users to create accounts using email, password and usernames. Users are able to post messages to a global feed which can be seen by all other users. Users can edit or delete their posts, change their profile picture, uesrname and password. This projects showcases advanced flask functions.", "depechecodes": "This is my portfolio website, designed to feature all of my past projects. It has been designed to easily navigate through my projects with a filter function to search through projects via their related tags. This project showcases my ability with front-end design, and my knowledge of HTML and CSS.", "mileagecalculator": "This was the first project I made. This used pure Python and could only be used in a CLI. Enter your current car mileage into the terminal and the calculator will update your CSV file with different information."}
